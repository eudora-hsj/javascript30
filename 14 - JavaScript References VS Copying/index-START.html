    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team1 = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team1[0] = 'Eudora'

    console.log(players, team1)
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'Betty'

    console.log(players, team2)

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    team3[0] = 'Claire'

    console.log(players, team3)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[0] = 'Dora'

    console.log(players, team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[0] = 'Eason'
    
    console.log(players, team5)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const someone = person;
    someone.number = 99

    console.log(person, someone)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const someone2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12})

    console.log(person, someone2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const someone3 = {...person}
    someone3.age = 50

    console.log(person, someone3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log('====');
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.age="10"                   // 不會改到wes
    dev.social.twitter="@eudora"   // 會改到wes!!

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.age="20"
    dev2.social.twitter="@dora"   // 不會改到wes

    console.log(dev);
